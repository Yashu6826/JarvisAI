Several options exist for a letter to a cricket club, depending on its purpose.  Please tell me what you want the letter to achieve.  For example, are you:

* **Applying for membership?**  I'll need to know your age, experience level, and any relevant information.
* **Sponsoring the club?** I'll need details about your sponsorship offer.
* **Requesting information?**  I'll need to know what information you're seeking (e.g., fixture list, membership fees, training schedules).
* **Complaining about something?** I'll need details about the issue.
* **Writing a thank you note?** I'll need to know who you're thanking and why.
* **Something else entirely?** Please describe the purpose.


Once I have this information, I can write a suitable letter for you.
